## Context and Problem Statement
The project requires a strategy for database object-relational mapping (ORM) and schema migrations. The chosen solution must support our PostgreSQL database, enable efficient schema evolution, and maintain data integrity. The solution should integrate well with our FastAPI application and support our development workflow.

## Decision Drivers
- Type safety
- Migration reliability
- Development efficiency
- Query performance
- Schema management
- Data integrity
- Rollback capability
- Integration ease

## Consider Options
1. **SQLAlchemy with Alembic**
   - Pros:
     - Mature Python ORM
     - Strong type safety
     - Excellent PostgreSQL support
     - Declarative model definitions
     - Automatic migration generation
     - Transaction support
     - Rich query API
     - Good FastAPI integration
   - Cons:
     - Learning curve
     - Some performance overhead
     - Complex for simple queries
     - Migration conflicts possible

2. **Django ORM with Migrations**
   - Pros:
     - Built-in migrations
     - Simple to use
     - Good documentation
     - Automatic admin interface
   - Cons:
     - Tied to Django
     - Less flexible
     - Overkill for our needs
     - Not suitable for FastAPI

3. **Raw SQL with Custom Migrations**
   - Pros:
     - Maximum performance
     - Full SQL control
     - No ORM overhead
     - Simple to understand
   - Cons:
     - Manual migration management
     - No type safety
     - More error-prone
     - Higher maintenance burden

## Decision Outcome
**UPDATE (2025-06):** The project has migrated to **Go with custom migration system**. This decision was driven by performance requirements and the need for a simpler, more maintainable solution. The Go migration system provides versioned migrations with tracking, transaction-based execution, and detailed logging. The original SQLAlchemy/Alembic analysis remains below for historical context.

**HISTORICAL:** SQLAlchemy with Alembic was selected as the database ORM and migration solution. This decision was driven by the need for type safety, reliable migrations, and good integration with our FastAPI application. SQLAlchemy's mature ORM capabilities and Alembic's migration tools provided a robust solution for managing our database schema and data access. While there was some performance overhead and learning curve, the benefits of type safety, automatic migration generation, and good PostgreSQL support outweigh these considerations. The solution aligns well with our Python-based stack and provides the necessary tools for maintaining data integrity during schema evolution.
