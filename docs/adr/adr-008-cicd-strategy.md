    - Zachary Maynard

## Context and Problem Statement
The project requires a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment of the calendar API. The chosen solution must integrate with our GitHub repository, support our container-based deployment strategy, and enable efficient development workflows. The solution should provide reliable automation while maintaining security and cost-effectiveness.

## Decision Drivers
- Build performance
- Security controls
- Cost effectiveness
- Integration capabilities
- Workflow flexibility
- Secret management
- Cache utilization
- Environment support

## Consider Options
1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Pros:
     - Native GitHub integration
     - Free for public repos
     - Built-in secret management
     - Docker layer caching
     - Matrix builds
     - Reusable workflows
     - Environment protection rules
     - Self-hosted runner support
   - Cons:
     - Limited concurrent jobs on free tier
     - GitHub-specific
     - Less flexible than some alternatives

2. **Jenkins**
   - Pros:
     - Highly customizable
     - Extensive plugin ecosystem
     - Self-hosted option
     - Mature platform
   - Cons:
     - Extremely high maintenance overhead
     - More complex setup
     - Requires infrastructure
     - Steeper learning curve

3. **GitLab CI**
   - Pros:
     - Integrated with GitLab
     - Good container support
     - Built-in registry
     - Comprehensive features
   - Cons:
     - Requires GitLab
     - Migration overhead
     - Less GitHub integration

## Decision Outcome
**GitHub Actions** has been selected as the CI/CD platform. This decision is driven by its native integration with our GitHub repository and its comprehensive feature set that meets our needs. The platform provides built-in support for container builds, secret management, and environment protection, aligning well with our Fargate deployment strategy. While the free tier has some limitations, it is sufficient for our current scale and development needs. The solution offers a good balance of features, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness while supporting our container-based deployment workflow.
