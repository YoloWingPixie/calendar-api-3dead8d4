## Context and Problem Statement
The project requires a Git branching strategy that supports efficient development, enables continuous integration, and maintains code quality. The chosen strategy must facilitate rapid development while ensuring stability and enabling effective code review processes. The solution should align with our CI/CD platform choice and support our team's development workflow.

## Decision Drivers
- Development velocity
- Code quality
- Merge complexity
- Review efficiency
- Release management
- Team collaboration
- Integration frequency
- Conflict resolution

## Consider Options
1. **Trunk-Based Development (TBD)**
   - Pros:
     - Short-lived feature branches
     - Frequent integration
     - Reduced merge conflicts
     - Simpler history
     - Faster feedback
     - Better code quality
     - Easier rollbacks
     - Continuous deployment support
   - Cons:
     - Requires strong testing
     - Needs good CI/CD
     - More frequent small PRs
     - Less feature isolation

2. **GitFlow**
   - Pros:
     - Clear release management
     - Feature isolation
     - Structured workflow
     - Well-documented
   - Cons:
     - Complex branching
     - Long-lived branches
     - More merge conflicts
     - Slower integration
     - Overhead for small teams

3. **GitHub Flow**
   - Pros:
     - Simple workflow
     - Quick deployments
     - Good for web apps
     - Easy to understand
   - Cons:
     - Less structured
     - Limited release management
     - May need additional tools
     - Less suitable for complex releases

## Decision Outcome
**Trunk-Based Development** has been selected as the Git branching strategy. This decision is driven by our need for rapid development and continuous integration. TBD's emphasis on short-lived branches and frequent integration aligns well with our CI/CD platform and container-based deployment strategy. While it requires strong testing practices and good CI/CD, these are already part of our development approach. The strategy will help maintain code quality while enabling efficient development and deployment.
