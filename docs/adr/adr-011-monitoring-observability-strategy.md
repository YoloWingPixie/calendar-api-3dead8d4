## Context and Problem Statement
The project requires a monitoring and observability strategy that supports our 99.9% SLO target while meeting the basic observability requirements. The solution must provide visibility into application health, performance, and errors without overcomplicating the implementation. The strategy should align with our AWS platform choice and support our container-based deployment.

## Decision Drivers
- SLO compliance (99.9%)
- Implementation simplicity
- Cost effectiveness
- AWS integration
- Container visibility
- Alert responsiveness
- Log management
- Health monitoring

## Consider Options
1. **AWS CloudWatch**
   - Pros:
     - Native AWS integration
     - Free tier available
     - Built-in container metrics
     - Log aggregation
     - Basic alerting
     - Health check integration
     - Cost-effective for our scale
     - Simple setup
   - Cons:
     - Basic visualization
     - Limited advanced features
     - Less flexible than alternatives
     - Basic log analysis

2. **Datadog**
   - Pros:
     - Comprehensive monitoring
     - Advanced visualization
     - Rich feature set
     - Excellent container support
     - Powerful alerting
   - Cons:
     - Higher cost
     - Overkill for our needs
     - More complex setup
     - Steeper learning curve

3. **Prometheus + Grafana**
   - Pros:
     - Open source
     - Powerful querying
     - Rich visualization
     - Strong community
   - Cons:
     - More infrastructure to manage
     - Higher operational overhead
     - More complex setup
     - Overkill for our scale

## Decision Outcome
**AWS CloudWatch** has been selected as the monitoring and observability solution. This decision is driven by our need for a simple, cost-effective solution that meets our basic requirements while supporting our 99.9% SLO target. CloudWatch's native AWS integration, free tier availability, and built-in container metrics make it the most practical choice for our current scale (1.2 RPS peak). While more comprehensive solutions like Datadog or Prometheus+Grafana offer more features, CloudWatch provides sufficient capabilities for our needs without unnecessary complexity or cost.
